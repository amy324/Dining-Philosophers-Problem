// Five philosophers dine together at the same table. Each philosopher has his own plate at the table.
// There is a fork between each plate. The dish served is a kind of spaghetti which has to be eaten with two forks.
// Each philosopher can only alternately think and eat. Moreover, a philosopher can only eat his spaghetti when he has both a left and right fork.
// Thus two forks will only be available when his two nearest neighbors are thinking, not eating. After an individual philosopher finishes eating,
// he will put down both forks. The problem is how to design a regimen (a concurrent algorithm) such that any philosopher will not starve; i.e.,
// each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or
// think (an issue of incomplete information).
